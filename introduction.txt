Brief Introduction About Myself
My name is Kevin Jayden Motuka, but most people call me Fathela. I am a hardworking and curious student from ALX with a strong interest in Economics,Psycology and Computer Science. I enjoy exploring how practical solutions, especially in areas like agriculture, infrastructure and data, can make daily life easier for ordinary people. My journey has been shaped by resilience and a desire to rise above challenging circumstances while staying grounded in my values.
I am passionate about learning and creating projects that matter. Whether it is designing a simple reporting app for farmers, analysing economic ideas or working on university applications, I put effort into understanding things deeply and expressing them clearly. I believe in empathy, growth and using knowledge to help others. I am still learning, but I am determined to build a future where I can contribute meaningfully and make my family proud.
